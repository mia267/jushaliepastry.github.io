        <h3>Lily's Valley</h3>
        <p>
          Lily's Valley has a sweet, lovely and very familiar flavor. The fragrant vanilla mousse layer made from Madagascar vanilla beans is the main theme of this cake.
          You will feel like eating a cool vanilla ice cream with a layer of hand-cooked jam from cherries and strawberries - fragrant and succulent. The highlight of the cake is also the crunchy almond crumble layer and the fresh green lemon peel cake layer.
          With a shape made from lovely flowers arranged on a pink mirror-coated background, Lily's Valley is a cake that is both delicious and pretty for you to easily choose.        </p>

        <h3>Daisy Sparkle</h3>
        <p>
          Starting from the fragrant outermost layer of coconut mousse, layering fresh coconut cake with lightly sour passion fruit cream, adding a layer of hand-cooked yellow Cat Chu mango jam - this has always been LaFuong Pastry's most popular cake flavor.
          When you eat it, you will taste the fresh tropical fruit, mixed with a very pleasant sweet and sour taste. Designed with a lovely crown, embellished with Daisy flowers on a shiny bright yellow glaze background. If you have never tried the cake at LaFuong, this should be your first taste.        </p>

        <h3>Be in Blosssom</h3>
        <p>
          Brings a great balance between mild sourness, sweetness and tanginess in one bite by using lychee, coconut and raspberries. It can be said that this is a very interesting combination between Asia and Europe. Not only is it special in flavor, Be in Blossom's cake layer also has two different textures: the soft, spongy feeling coming from the Coconut Sponge layer and a bit of crunchiness from fresh coconut fibers in the Dacquoise layer.
          This is not only a great gift, but also a worthy choice for any birthday party, meeting with friends or family gatherings.        </p>

        <h3>Beloved Darling</h3>
        <p>
          If you're a fan of chocolate, try Beloved Darling - a mousse made from high-quality dark chocolate, topped with hand-cooked raspberry jam and a crémeux made from Madagascar vanilla beans. .
          Just like the explosion of flavor, the cake's appearance is decorated with a red mirror coating combined with a luxurious bronze-coated feather. This will be the perfect choice for all your parties.

        <img src="image/5.jpg" alt="Orient Scent">
        <h3>Orient Scent</h3>
        <p>A cake with a minimalist, elegant design, but containing a profound meaning. Orient Scent cake was born with the message of fullness & goodness. "Round Heaven - Square Earth" is as simple as that, created on a cool green mirrored background with a square shape representing the earth & a circle symbolizing the sky. The main flavors are fresh mango and pandan leaves - a bold Asian flavor, combined with European cream cheese, this cake will bring a fresh, fragrant and sweet feeling when enjoyed.</p>

      <li>
        <img src="image/6.jpg" alt="Whisper White">
        <h3>Whisper White</h3>
        <p>
          The first note you will feel will be the fresh taste of the slow-cooked red orange jam. Next is the gentle sweetness of a layer of crémeux made from pure dark chocolate and the lingering aftertaste will be the richness of a layer of mousse made from Earlgrey tea that has been cooled overnight. With an elegant white mirror-coated appearance, adorned with delicate falling feathers, Whisper White feels neutral enough that you can comfortably give it to your loved one whether he or she is male or female.

    <p>Jushalie Pastry has been in the baking business since 1992 providing small town's bakery expeditions for 20 years. 
      We keep our store small to minimize our impact on the areas that are far from us and to ensure the other local bakery stores are not stressed or overwhelmed. 
      Our store is a tight knit group of expert Chefs in the field of baking. All of our employees are passionate about creating and serving. 
      We are all professional bakers and experts at pastries, so we can give you lots of information, and believe me, we have a lot to share.

        <h4>Mary</h4>
        <p>Jushalie was great to work with. We had a problem with a prominent bakery in Monroeville and called her that day and she said she would make time to meet with us that very day. 
          She took so much time with my daughter and her fiancee as well as the parents of the bride and groom. We were so happy.

        <p>
          Never disappointed when I stop at Jushalie. We’ve got birthday cakes, cupcakes, cookies, pepperoni rolls and novelty cakes there over the years, it’s all fresh and delicious. 
          The employees are friendly and helpful and the prices are very reasonable.
          Cold brew fans, Patti’s is the best around

        <h4>Jim</h4>
        <p>I have been to other bakeries, and this is the best. It’s comfortable here. The customer service is outstanding. Plus, they support the community. 
          They are good people. They make you feel like family. I included the tag off the box in everyone’s tray, so that they, too, would know just where I got these amazing cookies. </p>

        <h4>Alan</h4>
        <p>I placed a very large assorted Christmas cookie order for this Christmas, and I can honestly say, the cookies were the BEST cookies 
          I have ever had in my life. I made up cookie trays for the members of my family as part of their Christmas gifts. Thank you guys for making me so proud to give your pastries!

        <h4>Susan</h4>
        <p>We initially chose Jushalie due to the location. It was very close to our wedding venue. From the initial contact to the delivery, everything was impressively great. 
          We chose 2 different layers/flavors: almond raspberry & strawberry champagne. They are amazing and inexpensive! 
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1></h1>
        <h4>Ben</h4>
        <p>We had Jushalie provide our wedding cake and several types of cookies for our recent wedding. Weebly's has been our go-to bakery for years– 
          and we would not trust anyone else to make our cake! Their items are always fresh and the icing is not the overly sweet kind you may find at some places.
